# snake-game
Object-Oriented Programming lecture project that was completed in August of 2017
- C++ program written in Microsoft Visual Studio that runs a Snake arcade game.
- User-controlled game object (snake) eats/collides with game object (mouse) causing another game object (mouse) to automatically generate in a randomized location on the game board. Process continues until the snake object collides with boundaries or itself.
- Implemented OOP concepts of inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, class, and object to create main features of game.
